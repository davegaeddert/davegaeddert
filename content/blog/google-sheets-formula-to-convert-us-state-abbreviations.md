title: Google Sheets formula to convert US State abbreviations

I had a simple problem yesterday. I was trying to import a spreadsheet of contacts into Salesforce, but the states in the addresses were all written as the abbreviations, when Salesforce wanted the full names.

Seemed like a simple enough problem, but I couldn't find a way to convert these easily. Being a stupid programmer, I thought I'd just make one. I only pushed it far enough to do the job. I didn't get it listed in the Google add-ons or anything, but went ahead and made a GitHub repo for it here: https://github.com/davegaeddert/google-sheets-us-states
