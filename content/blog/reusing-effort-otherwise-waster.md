title: Reusing effort otherwise "waster"
---

One concept I've always loved is the idea of utilizing effort that is otherwise lost. By that I mean capturing time and energy that we spend every day, and getting as much value out of it as possible.

Probably best illustrated by example:

##### Recaptcha
Every time you fill out a recaptcha, [you're doing more than proving you're a human](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/#creation-of-value). You are the human cog in "digitizing text, annotating images, building machine learning datasets". I think this was the first time this concept really hit me.

##### Duolingo
Duolingo does something similar. By using Duolingo, people are crowdsourcing translations for websites. For Duolingo, it makes for a [pretty interesting business model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo#Business_model). This is part of the reason why they're able to provide such a wonderful free service. [CNN and Buzzfeed](http://blog.duolingo.com/post/64024962586/duolingo-now-translating-buzzfeed-and-cnn) are being translated by you learning Spanish.
