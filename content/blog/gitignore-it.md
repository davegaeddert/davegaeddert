Last week I had a little free time and started a small side project. I've had it on my list for a while - I imagine most developers have a list somewhere of ideas for projects or apps, some complex and some simple. This one is simple.

Back when I was just getting started with Git, It felt like there were a lot of things to learn all at once. The nature of .gitignore and the philosophy behind it was one of those things. I always like to learn the reasoning behind things before using them, but sometimes you just need a kickstart - like which dot files shouldn't be tracked and how to keep them out of your repo! .DS_Store is a prime example.

I was surprised to find that there wasn't anything that could just step me through how, why, and what should be in .gitignore. Eventually I came across [github/gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/) and knew that was the place to start. Although it's several years later than when I had the original idea, I couldn't bare to throw it away. I always had doubts about its true usefulness, but I decided to make it anyway, even despite finding some similar sites out there (which don't do a great job if you ask me). This is just a start, I plan to add more information to the site about how to properly use .gitignore and how to set up a global .gitignore.

# Here it is: http://gitignore.it#

More to come about this.
