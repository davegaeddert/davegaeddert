title: Multiple tabs in Chrome with different sessions
---

I work on a lot of web apps. Sometimes they get pretty complicated and I end up viewing the site as one user in Chrome, another in an incognito window, and another in Safari. I've been doing this for a long time. It wasn't until recently that I realized this, and realized how dumb it was.

After a quick search and a little looking around, I decided to try this Chrome extension. Turns out, it's pretty great (don't be deterred by the look of it). All you do is click the toolbar button to open a new tab that has its own session - each tab can then be like its own incognito window and you can sign in to whatever accounts you need without affecting the rest of your browser.
