## Day to day

**I don‚Äôt like mornings.**
Never have, and I'm not sure I ever will.
If something is scheduled for the morning, then I will be there and have no problem with that.
Otherwise, I don't set an alarm and have to concrete time that I plan to be at work.
I wake up when I'm ready, or in recent years, when my family needs me to.
That said, I'm usually working by 9 or 10am on most days.

**I like to have a ‚Äúworking lunch‚Äù.**
You probably won't see me sitting around and chatting with co-workers over lunch.
My days are short enough as-is (self-inflicted),
and I prefer to use lunch as a time to continue thinking about what I'm working on.
Processing things while physically away from a computer usually does a lot of good for me.
If I am eating lunch with somebody, we're probably talking about work related things.

**I try not to do "deep work" after 11pm anymore.**
I say "try" because I still do it sometimes.
But always at the detriment of any real sleep.
For a long time it was one of my most productive times of the day,
but I'm getting old and my mornings are a little different than they used to be (üëã hi family!).

**I don‚Äôt make a lot of effort to greet people on my way in or out of the office.**
I promise it's not personal.
As soon as I walk out the door of my house, my mind is at work.
You'll probably see me walking faster than I need to be,
with my head down,
chomping at the bit to get to my office.
If I don't stop to talk it's because I don't want to get distracted before I even make it to my desk.

## Conversationally

**I finish people‚Äôs sentences sometimes.**
If I do, it usually means that I'm very engaged and am trying to push the conversation forward more quickly.
If it's bothering you, I can usually tell and try to stop. If I don't, then tell me!

**I cut people off or abruptly change topics sometimes.**
If I do, it's because my mind has moved on and it feels like we all should.
If you weren't ready, say something and I will re-enagage.





I don‚Äôt like to talk about myself (or my work).

I over explain things sometimes. At least it feels that way to me.

I have a hard time letting problems or potential improvements in others work slip by.

I don‚Äôt like having things on my schedule. They make me anxious and unproductive.

I don‚Äôt like repetitive tasks.

I get carried away with building things. Better about this now than I was before.

I learn things by doing. And I don‚Äôt go deep on topics ‚Äî just deep enough.

It takes me a long time to condense down into written form for others to easily consume. Probably the same reason conversations with me about seemingly simple things can take so long.

I don‚Äôt like talking to clients/customers on the phone. It‚Äôs probably a flaw. But, I think that solving other people‚Äôs problems is hard, and the best answer is usually not the first one. So I prefer to think on it alone. You could probably say that information gathering is easier though over the phone or chat vs email. I have a product want for this.

(Could order this chronologically, like a day, at least in part)

I have a hard time knowing when to hand things off.

I like solving problems. If you‚Äôre talking to me, and a problem comes up, I‚Äôll really want to solve it ‚Äî even if it isn‚Äôt mine to solve

I‚Äôm better at buying books than reading them. They kind of serve as physical placeholders for ‚Äúideas worth exploring when the time comes‚Äù. I find that all books are not relevant at all times. A good book to read today might not be such a good read a year from now ‚Äî relevancy matters. (Non fiction anyway). It‚Äôs more like a personal library. https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf

I really like to build things. It‚Äôs how I learn. It‚Äôs also when ideas become concrete and have to live or die.

I like to be right. But I don‚Äôt dislike it when I‚Äôm wrong. I wish people would push back on me more often. If we can‚Äôt come up with a better answer, then the one we have is probably good enough.

I try to be nice. And think that I usually am. But I know some critiques can be painful regardless (they are to me too). If I provide a critique, it‚Äôs because I really think it needs to be said ‚Äî not just because I want to put someone down. If I don‚Äôt see an upside to it, I won‚Äôt say it and often don‚Äôt unless I‚Äôm frustrated. I have a hard time balancing this sometimes ‚Äî it depends on my mood. Some days I call out lots of problems. Other days I don‚Äôt. It ebbs and flows with my mood and the mood of others and the work.

I can often be part (or all) of the reason meetings go too long. Most of the stuff I‚Äôm involved in are with small teams, who do lots of other things too, and don‚Äôt share ideas as much as I‚Äôd like. So when we‚Äôre together a lot of stuff can come spilling out. And I‚Äôm pretty much ok with that. I try to be good about keeping it relevant and useful for everyone involved. But if it isn‚Äôt, tell me so we can all move on. Odds are that I want to move on too but am talking until I get the sense that an idea is clicking or it is not, so that I know what to do with it.

A good chunk of my time is spent building things to make others more effective at their job. But everybody thinks and works differently. If I don‚Äôt get any feedback, then I am going to do what makes the most sense to me personally. A lot of times though, the thing I‚Äôm building will be used by others more than I‚Äôll use it myself. I get frustrated when this is the case and there‚Äôs not much input to go off of.
